## 🚫 The Anti-Tutorial Hell Philosophy

**Traditional tutorials create passive learners.** You follow steps, copy code, and feel like you understand—until you face a real problem alone.

**Our challenges force active learning.** You'll struggle, research, experiment, and eventually solve problems independently.

This struggle is not a bug—it's the feature that builds genuine developer confidence.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account (for backend features)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mahfuz0001/sense.git
   cd sense
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Update `.env` with your Supabase credentials:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   VITE_APP_ENV=development
   ```

4. **Set up the database**
   - Create a new Supabase project
   - Run the SQL commands from `database/schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor
   - This will create all necessary tables, RLS policies, and sample data

5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
